<h1>Syllabus</h1>

<h2>Course summary</h2>

<p>
The goal of this course is to teach students fundamental and
cutting-edge concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and provide
hands-on experience developing NLP applications in the form of
programming assignments in Python. Students are expected to have
programming experience and either be familar with Python or able to
quickly learn it during the first assignment.
</p>

<p>
As we'll explore in the course, natural language is often ambiguous,
and machine learning is crucial to making decisions under
uncertainty. Many other tools in basic artificial intelligence (e.g.,
planning, knowledge representation and reasoning) also play a role in
understanding and responding to natural language. However, this class
is aimed at students with a general background in computer science
(i.e., you don't need to take a machine learning or AI course as a
prerequisite). We will cover the necessary machine learning and basic
AI material in this course.
</p> 

<p>
The topics tentatively planned for this semester are listed below and
include speech processing (language modeling, speech recognition,
speech synthesis), linguistic foundations (parts of speech, syntax,
speech disfluencies, semantics, dialogue, discourse), machine
learning, and applications (information retrieval, information
extraction, machine translation, natural language generation, dialogue
systems, automated grading). There is no required text book for the
course; we will use lectures to cover the material.  References for
optional reading materials will be provided for each lecture but there
will be no required readings. One source of material for the course is
Jurafsky and Martin's book "Speech and Language Processing." The
second edition was published in 2009. While the third edition is being
written, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/">the draft
chapters are available free and along with their class slides.</a> Notable chapters include:
<ul>
<li>Chapter 4: Naives Bayes Classification</li>
<li>Chapter 19: Word Senses and WordNet</li>
<li>Chapter 20: Semantic Role Labeling and Argument Structure</li>
<li>Appendix A: Hidden Markov Models</li>
</ul>


Interested students can continue
their study with other courses in
USC's <a href="https://cl.usc.edu/courses/"> computational linguistics
curriculum</a>.

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>
There will be a variety of resources used in this course to faciliate 
online discussion, distributing grades, and submitting coursework. We 
anticipate using the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blackboard.usc.edu/">Blackboard</a>: lecture slides, grades</li>
<li><a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a>: discussion board (first place to go to ask questions) and announcements</li>
<li><a href="https://labs.vocareum.com/main/main.php">Vocareum</a>: used for your programming assignments</li>
<li><a href="https://usc.zoom.us">Zoom</a>: lectures, office hours</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h2>Programming assignments</h2>

<p>
Each assignment will have a specific rubric, but generally, the grades
will depend on the performance of a system on unseen test data and a
short technical report describing experiments on data provided (seen
data). Each assignment will also have its own late policy, but
generally there will be a penalty for each day late rapidly increasing
to a zero grade on the assignment.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Assignment 1: Due February 23rd, 4pm.
<ul>
<li><a href="assignment1/CS544-assignment1.pdf">Description (PDF)</a></li>
<li><a href="assignment1/Report.txt">Report template</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Assignment 2: Due April 13th, before midnight.
<ul>
<li><a href="assignment2/CS544-assignment-two.pdf">Description (PDF)</a></li>
<li><a href="assignment2/SWBD-DAMSL-Report.txt">Report template</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Assignment 3: Ungraded.
<ul>
<li><a href="CS544_assignment3_ungraded.pdf">Description (PDF).</a></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
The first exam is in-class and closed: no books, no notes, no calculators, no
electronic devices, etc. All arithmetic is simple and
straightforward. You should bring a pen or dark pencil: exams will be
scanned for grading, so the writing needs to be dark enough to show up
on the scan. 
</p>

<p>

The final exam will be open-note, open-book and taken online via
Blackboard.  It is strictly individual, and no collaboration is
allowed. Although the final exam will not directly include
problems of a type covered by the first exam, there may be some
overlap if similar methods are used in the second half of the course.

</p>

<p>
In the lecture slides for the course, we will work through questions
and problems similar to those on the exams. The best way to study for
exams is to work through the questions and problems in the lecture
materials.
</p>

<h2>Grading Scheme</h2>

<ul>
<li>20% in-class exam #1</li>
<li>20% Assignment 1</li>
<li>20% Assignment 2</li>
<li>40% on-line, take-home, final exam taken during the final exam period</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: when all the grades are released, students will be emailed with instructions and the deadline
for requesting equal weight to be assigned to the four graded items (i.e., two exams, two assignments).
