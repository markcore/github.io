<h1>CSCI 544 Applied NLP: Group Project Presentations</h1>

<h2>Your presentation time</h2>

<p>

Presentations will be given on <b>November 21st, November 28th and
November 30th during the 4pm and 6pm class sections</b>. The
preliminary schedule is on BlackBoard. Based on requested changes, we
will be modifying the schedule and posting a final schedule
soon. Check Piazza for announcements. In terms of the order of
presentations in a particular slot (e.g., November 21st, 4pm), we will
roughly go in the same order as listed in the spreadsheet. 

</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>

The presentations will be graded pass/fail. Failure for a group to
give a presentation will result in 15% being subtracted from the project grade
of every group memeber.

</p>

<h2>Getting materials to us</h2>

<p>

If you are presenting on November 21st, email Mark and Kallirroi any
slides you wish to project during your presentation on or
before <b>Sunday, November 20th</b>.  If you are presenting the next
week, email Mark and Kallirroi any slides on or
before <b>Sunday, November 27th</b>.Given the large number of student
presentations, all groups will be using the computer provided by the
instructors which will have a copy of these slides. <b>PDF format is
preferred</b>. We have PowerPoint 2010 for Windows but there is no
guarantee that your slides will look the same on our computer as they
do on your computer.
</p>

<h2>Your presentation</h2>

<p>
You should plan for a <b>five minute</b> presentation, and we suggest
that a single member of the group give the presentation to minimize
time spent switching speakers. Your first slide should be a title
slide with the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A title summarizing what the project is about.</li>
<li>Your group number (see the copy of the proposal we sent you or check the schedule).</li>
<li>All the names of your group members with the person presenting <u>underlined</u>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can include as many slides as you want after the title (but
remember you only have 5 minutes). Text and pictures are fine but we
will not be able to support video or audio. Given the short
presentation time, we recommend that you quickly state the goal of the
project, your methodology and your evaluation.
</p>

<h2>Report on presentations of other groups</h2>

<p>
You will need to take notes during the presentations. Your final summative experience will be to 
summarize the presentations
of <b>ten other groups</b>. For each group you will need to include
answers to the following questions in your report:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the group's number?</li>
<li>What was the goal of the group's project?</li>
<li>How did the group attempt to accomplish the goal?</li>
<li>How did the group evaluate their work and what was the result?</li>
</ul>

See the course website for more information on the final summative experience.
