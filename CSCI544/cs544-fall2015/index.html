<b>Course summary:</b>
</p>
<p>
This course covers both fundamental and cutting-edge topics in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and provides students with hands-on experience in NLP applications. This is part of USC's <a href="http://cl.usc.edu/courses.html">curriculum in computational linguistics</a>.
The course
will roughly follow the previous semester's course taught by Kenji
Sagae
(see <a href="http://appliednlp.bitbucket.org/">http://appliednlp.bitbucket.org</a>). There will be some differences in topics covered and assignments/projects. Like the previous course, there will be no exams. The grade for the class will be based only on assignments and a project. There will be no final exam and the class will finish December 4th at midnight (i.e., the last project/assignment will be due at that time or earlier).

</p>

<p>
<b>Grading:</b>

<ul>
<li>Programming assignments (4 x 15%): the grades will depend on the performance of a system and a technical report.</li>

<li>Research project (40%): this will be a group project, graded individually: 30% of the grade will depend on the project's relevance to the course, degree of difficulty, amount of work, correctness and written report. 10% of the grade will depend on a written report about projects from other groups.</li>
</ul>
</p>
