<h1>CSCI 544: Git basics</h1>

<h3> What is Git? </h3>

<p> <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a modern <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">version control system</a>.
 Amongst other benefits, it allows you to save snapshots of your project
 allowing you view (and revert to, if necessary) previous versions of 
your work. This is especially critical when working in a team as you'll 
often need to unwind conflicting changes or figure out precisely 
when/what changes were made. Version control is an absolutely essential 
part of any software project and a little bit of time spent learning the
 basics will pay off many times over.</p>

<h3> Installing Git</h3>
<p>From the command line, just type:<br>
<code>
$ sudo apt-get install git<br>
</code>

</p><hr>

<h3> Setting up a repository </h3>

<p>For this class, we'll be using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a> for handling remote storage of repositories (another popular service is <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>).
 Although you don't need to have a remote repository (Git will work just
 fine locally), having a remote repository both gives you a remote 
backup (nice if something happens to your entire machine) and makes 
sharing easy if you ever need it (as you will for all assignments for 
this class).

</p><p>Getting started is easy. First, <a href="bitbucket-help/bitbucket.html">create a new repository on Bitbucket</a>.</p> 

<p>Then, from the command line type:<br><br>
<code>
$ mkdir /path/to/your/new/project<br>
$ cd /path/to/your/new/project<br>
$ git init<br>
$ git remote add origin https://YOUR_USERNAME@bitbucket.org/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git<br>
</code>

</p><p>In the above examples replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Bitbucket 
username and REPOSITORY_NAME with the name of the repository you just 
created on Bitbucket (Bitbucket will also prompt you with these commands
 after creating a new repo).</p>

<h3> Checking in a new file </h3>

<p>After creating a repository and linking it to Bitbucket, you'll want 
to get to work. Let's say you've started a new file called "test.py" 
and, after getting a few lines in, want to save your work. From the 
command line in your project directory, just type:<br>
<code>
$ git add test.py<br>
$ git commit -m "adding test.py (or whatever message describes your work)"<br>
$ git push origin master<br>
</code>

</p><p>Let's look at each of those commands.</p>

<p><code>git add test.py</code><br> tells git that this is a file you 
want under version control (often there will be plenty of files, for 
example temp files or compiled files that you wouldn't want in version 
control).</p>

<p><code>git commit -m "some message"</code><br> is what actually 
commits (stores) your changes locally. Every commit is required to have a
 commit message. The -m flag allows you to directly enter that message 
on the command line (in quotes). Although it may seem like a waste, 
descriptive commit messages can be extremely useful when trying to 
remember what you did (and even more so when working in a team and 
trying to figure out what someone else did!).</p>

<p><code>git push origin master</code><br> is what actually pushes the 
changes up to your remote repository. It's very easy to forget this 
final step (especially if you're used to some other version control 
systems), so make sure to get in the habit of always pushing your 
changes after a commit.</p>

<hr>

<h3> Updating your code </h3>

<p>If you are working in a team or just working on multiple computers 
and want to pull down the latest version of your work, there are two 
commands you need to know.</p>

<p>If you are pulling down an existing repository for the first time, use the <code>clone</code> command. For example:<br>
<code>
$ git clone https://YOUR_USER@bitbucket.org/YOUR_USER/REPO_NAME.git<br>
</code>

</p><p>If you already have a copy of the repository and just want to pull down the latest changes, just use the <code>pull</code> command. For example (from your project directory):<br>
<code>
$ git pull<br>
</code>

</p><p>During a pull, if there are parts of the code that need to be 
merged (for example, if two people have modified the same file), git 
will prompt you to resolve any conflicts. This is far superior to just 
overwriting each other's work!</p>
