<h1>CSCI 544 Applied NLP: Final Project</h1>
<h2>Due Date: December 6th, 2015 (11:59 PM PST)</h2>

<h2>Updates / Clarifications</h2>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> we guarantee that we will keep the Blackboard
assignment open up to (and including) December 6th. Note, ignore any
late notice given by Blackboard. As long as you are able to submit
your report via Blackboard, it will be considered "on time".
</p>

<p>
<b>Clarification:</b> we prefer a single Bitbucket repository for each
group. Individual group members are not required to create separate
Bitbucket repositories.
</p>

<p>
<b>Clarification:</b> you can write summaries of any 10 group
presentations (excluding your own) given on November 30 and December
2.
</p>

<h2>Submitting your individual final report</h2>

<p>
You must use <a href="individual_project_report_template.txt">the
report template</a> to write your individual final report. You may
keep your report in text format or submit a PDF version. Submit your
report via the Blackboard assignment, Individual Final Project Report,
by uploading your report file.
</p>

<h2>Submitting your code/data</h2>

<p>
You will be primarily graded based upon your individual final
report. However, we need access to any code or annotated data that you
created. Software/data should either be mentioned in the Project
Resources section of your report with a URL for download, or the
software/data should be included in a Bitbucket repository that we can
access.  You can give this bitbucket repository any name you like, but
you must include the name in your final report. Remember to give Admin
privileges to csci544-f15-grader as described in
<a href="bitbucket-help/bitbucket.html">
our help page</a>. Avoid as much as possible including software/data
in this repository that can be downloaded from a public source. It is
preferred that each group have a single repository rather than
separate repositories for individual group members.

</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
You will receive a grade for the final project based primarily on your
individual report. However, it is very important that someone give a
presentation of the group's work. <b>Failure to have a group
presentation will result in 15% being subtracted from the grade of
every group member.</b>
</p>

<p>
25% of the grade is based upon sections 5 - section 14 of your final
report which are your summaries of 10 presentations of your
classmates.
</p>

<p>
The Project Overview and Project Resources sections of your final
report are worth 25% of your grade. The Project Overview section is
your personal view of the project's goal, methodology and evaluation
plan. To earn all points, your group must have a reasonable goal,
methodology and evaluation, and you must describe this plan clearly in
your report. Note, this 25% of your grade applies to a description of
the entire project, NOT just your part. The Project Resources are
references for all publicly available software and data that you used
in the project including their URLs. It should be clear from the
report what each item is, and how it was used in the project.
</p>

<p>
The My Project Tasks section of your final report is worth 50% of your
grade. There are two purposes to this section. First, we want detailed
descriptions of the tasks performed in the project (e.g., data
gathering, annotation, inter-annotator agreement calculations,
programming and experimentation). You should describe any tasks you
performed. Second, we will use this section to judge the amount of
effort that each group member performed. To address this second goal,
you can include a paragraph at the end explaining tasks where you did
not have a primary role but helped in some way (e.g., wrote a script
to process some XML data). You can also mention tasks such as being
the group presenter.
</p>

<h2>Late Policy and Other Rules</h2>

<p>
No late submissions will be allowed. If you are able to submit your
final report via Blackboard, you will be graded without penalty. If
the Blackboard assignment is closed, you will receive 0 points. We
guarantee that we will keep the Blackboard assignment open until December
5th, 2015.
</p>

<p>
This is a group project and you are allowed to use software and data
that you find on the Internet. However, your individual project report
must be written solely by you with the only allowable exception being
the Project Resources section. You must document any software/data
that you download (i.e., in the Project Resources section of your
report) and that is not generated by your group. In general you must
follow the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/schools/GraduateSchool/academic_conduct.html">USC standards of academic conduct</a>.
