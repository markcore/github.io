<h1>CSCI 544 Applied NLP: Group Project Presentations</h1>

<h2>Your presentation time</h2>

<p>
Presentations will be given on <b>November 30th and December 2nd
during the 4pm and 6pm class sections</b>. The preliminary schedule is
on BlackBoard. Based on requested changes, we will be modifying the
schedule and posting a final schedule soon. Check Piazza for
announcements.
</p>

<h2>Getting materials to us</h2>

<p>
Email Mark and Kallirroi any slides you wish to project during your
presentation on or before <b>Sunday, November 29th</b>. Given the
large number of student presentations, all groups will be using the
computer provided by the instructors which will have a copy of these
slides. <b>PDF format is preferred</b>. We have PowerPoint 2010 for
Windows but there is no guarantee that your slides will look the same
on our computer as they do on your computer.
</p>

<h2>Your presentation</h2>

<p>
You have <b>five minutes</b> for your presentation so we suggest that
a single member of the group give the presentation. Your first slide
should be a title slide with the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A title summarizing what the project is about.</li>
<li>Your group number (see the copy of the proposal we sent you or check the schedule).</li>
<li>All the names of your group members with the person presenting <u>underlined</u>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can include as many slides as you want after the title (but
remember you only have 5 minutes). Text and pictures are fine but we
will not be able to support video or audio. Given the short
presentation time, we recommend that you quickly state the goal of the
project, your methodology and your evaluation.
</p>

<h2>Report on presentations of other groups</h2>

<p>
You will need to take notes during the presentations. As part of your
individual final report, you will need to summarize the presentations
of <b>ten other groups</b>. For each group you will need to include
answers to the following questions in your report:
</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the group's number?</li>
<li>What was the goal of the group's project?</li>
<li>How did the group attempt to accomplish the goal?</li>
<li>How did the group evaluate their work and what was the result?</li>
</ul>
